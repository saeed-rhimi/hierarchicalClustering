# Hierarchical Clustering Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of hierarchical clustering techniques on a customer dataset. The primary objective is to segment customers based on their shopping behaviors and other relevant features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is 'Mall_Customers.csv', which contains information about mall customers, including features such as customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

## Analysis Approach
- The data is first preprocessed, including one-hot encoding of categorical variables and normalization, if applicable.
- A dendrogram is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Hierarchical clustering is applied to segment the customers into distinct groups based on their features.

## Key Highlights of Code
{code_highlights[:500]}  # Including only a snippet of code highlights for brevity

## Visualization
The results of the clustering are visualized using scatter plots, with different colors representing different clusters. This provides an intuitive understanding of the customer segments.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn

## Installation and Usage
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/saeed-rhimi/hierarchicalClustering.git`
- Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the Jupyter notebook to see the analysis and results.
